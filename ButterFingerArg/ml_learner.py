This trains a model to classify languages based on a sample of the language. in this case we are just training to choose between ciphertext of english put through a vigenere cipher "cyf" and english phrases "eng". It then takes this trained model and writes it to IN_FILE as a picklefile. The labeled data is found initially in INFILE.
